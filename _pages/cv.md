Education
======
* Integrated MSc in Physics Engineering, University of Minho, 2021
* Ph.D in Informatics, University of Minho, 2026 (expected)

Projects
======
* MSc Thesis: Ansätze for Noisy Variational Quantum Eigensolvers
  * Supervisors: Raffaele Santagati, Ernesto Galvão, Mikhail Vasilevskiy
  * Description: Studied and implemented multiple variational quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry (electronic structure problem), with a focus on ADAPT-VQE (multiple variants). Ran these algorithms in real devices and via simulation, and studied their noise-resilicence properties using Qiskit's noise module.
* PhD Dissertation: Quantum Algorithms for Optimization in the NISQ Context (ongoing)
  * Supervisors: Luís Paulo Santos, Ernesto Galvão
  * Goals: Studying and developing new NISQ-friendly algorithms for optimization tasks, for quantum chemistry and classical combinatorial optimization problems.
